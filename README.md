# romset_cleaner
An executable that cleans up a romset for actual use.

Have you ever had a massive directory full of ROMs from all sorts of different regions, but you just want the ones for your region?
I, for one, have 7 different versions of "Pokemon Snap" on my computer, and all I actually need is the USA version.

There is both a python script, with a compiled executable, as well as a Visual Studio C++ GUI program.
The GUI program has more features and is much easier to use, but requires Windows Vista or newer and C++ 17 or higher.
