# romset_cleaner
A python executable that cleans up a romset for actual use.

Have you ever had a massive directory full of ROMs from all sorts of different regions, but you just want the ones for your region?
I, for one, have 7 different versions of "Pokemon Snap" on my computer, and all I actually need is the USA version.

This script takes a directory and a list of country codes, then moves all of the ROMs you actually want to use into a new folder.
