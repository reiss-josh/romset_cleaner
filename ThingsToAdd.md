If I ever feel compelled to work on this again, future note to self:

The only real "missing feature" per se is the lack of any notification when the program finishes moving the files.

It might also be nice to have a checkbox flag that lets you disable the actual movement of the files, so you can try reading the output logs first and verify it's going to do what you want.
